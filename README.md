## Summary
As the population of the United States continues to grow older, the prevalence of heart disease increases. Ventricular remodeling is a result of a number of heart conditions where the left ventricle “balloons” outward as a result of compensatory mechanisms the heart must undergo to be able to pump blood efficiently to the rest of the body. 3D ultrasound technology has brought about novel ways to analyze the degree of dilation in a person’s left ventricle, but the volume of data that must be processed and the poorly defined ways of analyzing this data have resulted in a barrier towards using 3D ultrasound with greater frequency in the clinic.

In this project, we propose a novel way to determine the sphericity of the ventricle using 3D ultrasound data and a novel way to automate one of the previous methods that has been used to determine the sphericity of the ventricle using 2D ultrasound data. We believe that the use of these two methods combined will result in greater diagnostic power to render 3D ultrasound more useful towards saving the lives of patients in the clinic.
